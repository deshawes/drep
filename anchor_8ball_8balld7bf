    "objectives": "To safeguard the long-term survival and prosperity of the Cardano blockchain by advocating for decentralized governance. My primary focus is on protecting the Treasury and ensuring the viability of small, professionally-run stake pools, which are critical to maintaining a decentralized network. Additionally, I am committed to supporting the Cardano development tools and popular applications on the blockchain, and to advancing the Cardano ecosystem through promotion and grassroots growth.",

    "qualifications": "I have been deeply involved in the Cardano ecosystem since 2017 and am one of the original independent single Cardano stake pool operators from the Incentivized Test Net. I operate with a commitment to decentralization, building all systems from source without reliance on common tools for installation or management, as the common approach exposes single points of failure within the ecosystem.",
